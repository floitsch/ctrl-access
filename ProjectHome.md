This chrome extension allows to navigate to links with a trigger key (by default the ctrl-key). In many cases this removes the need for a mouse.
This extension is a copy of Konqueror's access-key functionality.


The extension can be installed [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glmoehiilkjpgcimmfodllkkhpeikomb).
